This repository contains all assignments completed for my reinfocement learning 
class, CS138. These include the following:

- Assignment 1: The 10-arrmed bandit problem
    In this project I created an RL environment to simulate the 10-armed bandit
    problem and demonstrate the challenges that sample average action-value 
    methods face in a non-stationary environment.
