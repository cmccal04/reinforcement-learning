Overview:
- bandit.py is a python file that simulates an n-armed bandit problem in a 
  non-stationary environment.
- The environment is implemented  with an adjustable sigma_walk, or standard 
  deviation, that is 0.01 by default. 
- This program uses both sample-average and constant step-size action value 
  methods, and an epsilon-greedy action selection method to solve the bandit-problem. 
  The epsilons used are 0, 0.1, and 0.01. The alpha for the constant step size 
  method is 0.1 by default.
- This bandit problem can run on any number of independent runs, which is 3,000 by 
  default. The number of time steps per run is also adjustable, and 10,000 by default.
- This program plots 3 different graphs: average reward vs. time, % optimal action 
  vs. time, and % action switch vs. time.

How to Run:
- python3, numpy, and matplotlib must be installed
- run command python3 bandit.py
